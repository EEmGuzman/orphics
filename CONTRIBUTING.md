# Contributing to orphics

The recommended contribution model is as follows. You first do the following once:

1. Fork this repo on github.com to get your own copy
2. Clone your fork to your local system. If you already had a clone of this repo (and not your fork), you can simply update the remote URL of origin to point to your new fork https://help.github.com/articles/changing-a-remote-s-url/
3. Add the original repo (wherever you forked it from) as a remote called `upstream` to your local system https://help.github.com/articles/configuring-a-remote-for-a-fork/
